# 4. Performance Benchmarks

## CPU benchmark questions

1. Look at your LINPACK measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

## Memory benchmark questions

1. Look at your memsweep measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

## Disk benchmark questions

1. Look at your disk write measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?
2. Which disk format did you use for qemu? How do you expect this benchmark to behave differently on other disk formats?

## Fork benchmark questions

1. Look at your fork sum measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?
2. [not optional] Why did we exclude this benchmark from the Rump Unikernel? How can you adapt the experiment for this platform?

## Nginx benchmark questions

1. Look at your nginx measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

2. How do your measurements relate to the disk benchmark findings?
